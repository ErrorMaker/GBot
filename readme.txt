Readme:

- Hide this extension by putting Tanji on a 2nd desktop (WIN10)
- Script the fuck out of whoever. I don't give a fuck.
- Credits to everyone in SC-P
- Open this extension BEFORE connecting Tanji so it will automatically grab headers (Shoutout to ArachisH for making that even possible)
- If you get exceptions for some reason, uncheck the "Visualize Field" checkbox
- This works for Tanji 1.3.2256 and above ONLY
- Read the full story on the history of gamble scripting here: http://mika.host/grabber.pdf (Shoutout to Wes for writing 7 pages, lol)
- Report this to Habbo so they forbid gambling in general. Even the wired games! (or don't, if you're gonna use it)
- Another shoutout to ArachisH, he's the best.
- So am I.
- And the scripting community.

Bye!

- Mika and the whole SC-P crew :D
